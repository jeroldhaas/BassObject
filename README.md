# BassObject
<p>

     Bass Object is a concept that we developed to bring awareness to how cool and beneficial code and tech can be to the youth and our communities as a whole. Bass Object is a play on the computer programming term "base object", which refers to a core group of computer code in which other code can reference or inherit from. We see each and everyone of us as a base object with the power to positively influence and inspire others, therefore our apparel reflects this concept with thought provoking code designed to spark both positive conversation and an interest in programming.

     With the amazing GitHub platform at our disposal, we are sharing the code printed on all of our products.  We think this is the perfect way to extend our goal of getting the youth of today's culture excited about tech.  We invite all to fork or download the code.  Also, in the spirit of git we'll consider pull request to be printed on future shirts.

     We are also aiming to associate each and every one of our shirts with a charity.  This is a work in progress, and we appreciate any feedback that you may have on the matter.  We think that the tech community is in position and has the power to change our world for the better.  With your support, our goal is to create hope, opportunity, and unity via the proceeds from the Bass Object brand.  Support our brand and lets make a difference together.  If you don't think we're doing enough then hold us accountable and let us know.  We're in this together!
